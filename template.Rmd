I'm an R Markdown document!

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
samp
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

This section is used to generate random data, and show in scatterplot.

```{r chunk_scatterplot, echo=TRUE}
plot_df =
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 100),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )
plot_df
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y =y)) + geom_point()
```

This is a comment.

    norm = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 1),
    logical = norm > 0,
    abs_norm = abs(norm)
  )
ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50)
